### HDX HAPI Example GeoJSON

This script runs monthly and provides supporting files for the [HDX HAPI Dashboard](https://ocha-dap.github.io/hdx-hapi-example/). The script retrieves a list of locations available in [HAPI](https://hdx-hapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and gets geojson data from the ITOS service.
